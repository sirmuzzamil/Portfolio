# [Project  1: Data cleaning ](https://github.com/sirmuzzamil/sirmuzzamil/blob/839b1486d4ded5b42af89fa7887f8da73116c72d/R%20Projects/Project_1.ipynb)
* Data cleaning involve different techniques based on the problem and the data type. Different methods can be applied with each has its own trade-offs.
* Overall, incorrect data is either removed, corrected, or imputed.
* In this project I attempt to clean a database then use machine learning to predict the prices of the missing value
* My goal is to showcase data cleaning techniques like , drop rows, replace null values with unknown or 0s then we will predict the missing value with a model.
* For example.
*	drop the rows containing Null values 
*	drop the columns containing Null values 
*	Replace Null values with 'Unknown' or 0 
*	Replace missing values with predicted values
